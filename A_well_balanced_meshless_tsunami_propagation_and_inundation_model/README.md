## A well-balanced meshless tsunami propagation and inundation model

We present a novel meshless tsunami propagation and inundation model. We discretize
the nonlinear shallow-water equations using a well-balanced scheme relying on radial basis
function based finite differences. For the innudation model radial basis functions are used
to extrapolate the dry region by close wet points. Numerical results against standard one-
and two-dimensional benchmarks are presented.

In the Matlab folder we present the code to reproduce the results of the benchmarks.
Therefore clone the this repository:

`git clone https://github.com/evankielley/GDD.git`

and run the **_benchmark.m_** file.
